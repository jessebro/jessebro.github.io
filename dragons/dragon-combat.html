<h1>Dragon combat</h1>    
    <h2>When Dragons Fight</h2>
    <p>Dragons fight when defending their home. Occasionly the babies fight over food or are just playing. Sometimes a dragon will try to steal food from a dragon from a different nest, resulting in a fierce battle, the elder dragon getting angry and the fighting dragons being punished.</p>
<h2>The Dragons Enemys</h2>    
    <p>Dragons have enemys like humans have enemys. Sometimes is nest vs nest. But mostly it's an evil dragon or a dragon poacher or trapper. The Sheild( male leader and protecter of family)protects his family with all his strength. Mostly the dragon wins, but sometimes dragons and their young are CKandE(Caught Killed and Eaten).</p>
    <h2>Weapons of the Dragon</h2>
    <p>Dragons have many weapons. They have talons, teeth and the best of all, their firey breath. But one dragons breeathes ice, and one breathes fire and plasma balls. The  Fire Spitter, the largest Firepod, breathes huge amounts of flame and poison pelets of fire. When it gets to hand to hand combat, the use their teeth and claws.</p>
