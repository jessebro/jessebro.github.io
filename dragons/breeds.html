    <h2>Breeds</h2>
        <p>
        The dragon breeds come in lots of types. They go from deadly venomous to cute and small dragons. A dragon breed name tells you something about the dragon itself(e.g.The Cocoa Bronze Tongue does have a bronze tongue and is cocoa brown).
        </p>    
    <h2>List of the Breeds</h2>
        <ul>

            <h2>Save Them</h2>
    <p>The dragons have very fire proof scales, which is why dragon poachers are constantly hunting them down. The dragon poachers might become to much even for the Noble Dragon. Then some dragons may become extinct.</p>
  <h2>Family Groups list</h2>      
    <ul>
        <li>Firepod</li>
        <li>Flightacon</li>
        <li>Miliam</li>
        <li>Fureck</li>
        </ul>    
       <h2>Dragon Specialties</h2> 
        <p>Every dragon has a special thing that it's born with. Like the Noble Dragon can breathe plasma and coloured fire and get an awesome power-up with a bond between a human and the dragon. The Bronze Tongue is a born theif. Silver Scales can change colour. But before the dragon can use it, it has to learn to use it.</p>
